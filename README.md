# GenAI-learnings

This repositories contains: 

1. Code snippets to run some of the open source and API boxed LLMs including OpenAI, Llama2 
2. Usage of some of the frameworks for LLMs including Pinecone, Langchain
3. Efficient Finetuning on Llama2
4. Usage of RAG

   ## What is an LLM

   Large Langugae Models are a medium that depict the application and capability of Generative AI. These models are built on a humogous corpus of data which is trained on billions of parameters taking in a lot of compute. Some of the examples include OpenAi's ChatGPT, Llama2, Falcon et al. These models are prevalent today both in Open source and boxed format which are only accessible through APIs.

   ## What is PineCone

   The usage of LLMs in the applications largely depends on the ability to convert the unstructured data into vectors and then eventually store as embeddings. Pinecone is an open source project that makes life easier for data scientist and developers to acheive this goal. Its a easy to use management suite for maintaining of embeddings, vector stores and indexes.

   ## What is Langchain

   Langchain is another framework which is open source and has gained immense popularity on  teh grounds of bringing multiple LLMs access to one platform. It also abstracts some of the tasks for applicationd evelopments using LLMs like chunking, data loading, transformations, access to LLLms and much more.

   ## Open Source model used in this repo: Llama2
