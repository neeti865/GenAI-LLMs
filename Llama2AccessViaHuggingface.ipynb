    "Benefiting from the development of deep learning, computer vision technology\n",
    "has been widely used in medical image analysis. Image segmentation is an important part of medical image analysis. In particular, accurate and robust medical\n",

    "Existing medical image segmentation methods mainly rely on fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) with U-shaped structure [3,4,5]. The typical\n",
    "U-shaped network, U-Net [3], consists of a symmetric Encoder-Decoder with\n",
    "skip connections. In the encoder, a series of convolutional layers and continuous down-sampling layers are used to extract deep features with large receptive\n",
    "fields. Then, the decoder up-samples the extracted deep features to the input\n",
    "resolution for pixel-level semantic prediction, and the high-resolution features\n",
    "of different scale from the encoder are fused with skip connections to alleviate\n",
    "the loss of spatial information caused by down-sampling. With such an elegant\n",
    "structural design, U-Net has achieved great success in a variety of medical imaging applications. Following this technical route, many algorithms such as 3D\n",
    "U-Net [6], Res-UNet [7], U-Net++ [8] and UNet3+ [9] have been developed for\n",
    "image and volumetric segmentation of various medical imaging modalities. The\n",
    "excellent performance of these FCNN-based methods in cardiac segmentation,\n",
    "organ segmentation and lesion segmentation proves that CNN has a strong ability of learning discriminating features.\n",
    "Currently, although the CNN-based methods have achieved excellent performance in the field of medical image segmentation, they still cannot fully meet\n",
    "the strict requirements of medical applications for segmentation accuracy. Image\n",
    "segmentation is still a challenge task in medical image analysis. Since the intrinsic locality of convolution operation, it is difficult for CNN-based approaches to\n",
    "learn explicit global and long-range semantic information interaction [2]. Some\n",
    "studies have tried to address this problem by using atrous convolutional layers [10,11], self-attention mechanisms [12,13], and image pyramids [14]. However,\n",
    "these methods still have limitations in modeling long - range dependencies. Recently, inspired by Transformerâ€™s great success in the nature language processing\n",
    "(NLP) domain [15], researchers have tried to bring Transformer into the vision\n",
    "domain [16]. In [17], vision transformer (ViT) is proposed to perform the image recognition task. Taking 2D image patches with positional embeddings as\n",
    "inputs and pre-training on large dataset, ViT achieved comparable performance\n",
    "with the CNN-based methods. Besides, data-efficient image transformer (DeiT)\n",
    "is presented in [18], which indicates that Transformer can be trained on mid-size\n",
    "datasets and that a more robust Transformer can be obtained by combining it\n",
    "with the distillation method. In [19], a hierarchical Swin Transformer is developed. Take Swin Transformer as vision backbone, the authors of [19] achieved\n",
    "state-of-the-art performance on Image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. The success of ViT, DeiT and Swin Transformer in image\n",
    "recognition task demonstrates the potential for Transformer to be applied in the\n",
    "vision domain.\n",
    "Motivated by the Swin Transformerâ€™s [19] success, we propose Swin-Unet\n",
    "to leverage the power of Transformer for 2D medical image segmentation in\n",
    "this work. To our best knowledge, Swin-Unet is a first pure Transformer-based\n",
    "U-shaped architecture that consists of encoder, bottleneck, decoder, and skip\n",
    "connections. Encoder, bottleneck and decoder are all built based on Swin Transformer block [19]. The input medical images are split into non-overlapping image\n",
    "Swin-Unet: Unet-like Pure Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation 3\n",
    "patches. Each patch is treated as a token and fed into the Transformer-based\n",
    "encoder to learn deep feature representations. The extracted context features are\n",
    "then up-sampled by the decoder with patch expanding layer, and fused with the\n",
    "multi-scale features from the encoder via skip connections, so as to restore the\n",
    "spatial resolution of the feature maps and further perform segmentation prediction. Extensive experiments on multi-organ and cardiac segmentation datasets\n",
    "indicate that the proposed method has excellent segmentation accuracy and robust generalization ability. Concretely, our contributions can be summarized as:\n",
    "(1) Based on Swin Transformer block, we build a symmetric Encoder-Decoder\n",
    "architecture with skip connections. In the encoder, self-attention from local to\n",
    "global is realized; in the decoder, the global features are up-sampled to the input resolution for corresponding pixel-level segmentation prediction. (2) A patch\n",
    "expanding layer is developed to achieve up-sampling and feature dimension increase without using convolution or interpolation operation. (3) It is found in\n",
    "the experiment that skip connection is also effective for Transformer, so a pure\n",
    "Transformer-based U-shaped Encoder-Decoder architecture with skip connection\n",
    "is finally constructed, named Swin-Unet.\n",
